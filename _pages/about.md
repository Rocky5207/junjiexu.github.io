Hi! I am currently a third-year undergraduate student in a dual-degree program between Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST), China, and South East Technological University (SETU), Ireland, under the supervision of [Prof. Bin Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HsR0Hr8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). In addition, I am a **visiting scholar** at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working with [Prof. Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/) (President’s Chair Professor, FIEEE).

My current research interests focus on the application of deep reinforcement learning for networking, world model–enhanced networking, large language model augmented networking, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.
